Review: not as bad as i was anticipating for what these noodles are virtually no calories gluten free free food they are wonderful they are slimy but if you chew them very well you will be fine the fishy smell is overwhelming and if you have a bad gag reflex do not breathe in the entire time you are cooking these i washed them for a few minutes boiled them sauteed them with walden farms calorie free pasta sauce for a few minutes i added about 3 cloves of chopped garlic and italian seasoning the fishy smell did go away they are very filling but the bag itself for the price is very expensive this is about one serving not sure if i will purchase again maybe eat a salad with walden farms calorie free dressing instead for a zero calorie meal as this was very difficult to finish

Review: always the lunchbox stable these chocolate cupcakes with their infamous white swirl down the middle are still one of my favorites no they do n't taste the same as they did in the 60s but then again what does the cream is what i notice the most not quite as creamy and lush as they used to be but well they are still great and taste great to the next generation they are also awesome frozen on a hot day they have to be considered an american staple especially since hallmark has turned them into a christmas ornament even though they do contain beef fat weird huh they are still good all cakes for the most part unless you use applesauce contain some sort of fat or oil to make them moist just jump on the treadmill for a couple of minutes and well there it goes great product been enjoying them for 40 years highly recommend

Review: these are turkish apricots that differ from varieties found in the you s dried turkish apricots are moister and thicker and have a somewhat tangy taste since these apricots are unsulphured they are brown sulphur is used manly to make fruits look more attractive sulphured apricots are yellow just as sulphured golden '' raisins are br br any bag of dried fruit organic or not will most likely have a piece or two that is drier and tougher than the rest made in nature is no different br br i find the fruit to be mostly sweet and chewy this is a good mid day snack dried apricots can also be finely chopped and cooked with oatmeal the bags are terrific i will continue to purchase these as the price is lower than health food stores and shipping is free on orders of 25 and up

Review: this drink is okay it has that in the dark ' nuclear green look the same as the margarita mixer stuff they sell at the grocery store i am not a fan of that stuff at all to me a margarita is simply tequila triple sec and lime juice and if you want it sweeter some orange or pineapple juice but for a non alcoholic sugar free margarita this might be as good as you can get i have n't finished the first bottle i mixed of it yet it 's been a week or so but if it were summer time i might enjoy it more br br a day later now i did go ahead and finish what was in my refrigerator but i did not like it too well also the plastic bottle i used which i often use for iced teas and other homemade drinks had a strange residue in the bottom that would not rinse out even with hot water and vigorous shaking so in to the recycle bin for the bottle i found this just a bit disturbing and will not be using the rest of the product 
Original summary: a bit fake flavored but acceptable 
Predicted summary:  not bad but not great


Review: i was skeptical about ordering this product due to the extremely reasonable price per pound compared to most other meat alternatives i was concerned that the stated 4 4 lb product weight would be composed mostly of liquid but the shipping rate was very reasonable so thought i would give it a try after recieving the product extremely fast shipping i was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the product texture density and ease of handling the size of the chicken '' strips is perfect for most recipes the heavy sealed bags were crammed with product with just a little broth to keep moist i have not yet tried it in a recipe but just popped a couple of the heated strips in my mouth and they have a mild curry flavor i ca n't stand the over salted over seasoned products of many manufacturers the meaty but not rubbery texture should lend themselves well to using in an endless variety of dishes even cold over salads i will definitely order this product and others in the manna soy line in the future oh yes the company even included a bunch of recipes 
Original summary: finally a quality meat alternative at a fair price 
Predicted summary:  excellent product

Review: first this product serves as a quick and easy starter to make your own tom yum by this i mean the dehydrated vegetables spice pack and noodles are a good start but if you add chicken or tofu or other protein you will have a more satisfactory meal it is nicely spicy on it 's own for people who like moderately spiced foods br br the base flavor is excellent i spice it up even further by adding a bit of chili paste rice vinegar and low sodium soy sauce speaking of sodium there 's too much in this product to begin so watch that if you have sodium issues br br i wish when manufacturer 's packaged a product like this they would understand that this is not a 2 serving meal '' this is a one serving meal the calories come from the noodles so i use half the packaged noodles and add my own protein and eat the whole thing in other words if you only eat half which is ridiculous for an adult then you are getting what annie chun 's calls a serving '' if you eat the entire bowl you are getting two servings br br long story short great taste easy to prepare but too much sodium for a meal 
Original summary: good start for your own soup 
Predicted summary:  quick easy and tasty


Review: i do like my coffee on the dark end of the roasting scale and this offering from timothy 's delivers it is a nice smooth smoky blend with even a hint of crema at brewing it also holds up well to cream if that is your preference the extra bold delivers the added punch that i routinely seek in my coffee although i must admit that the 'espresso ' name is a bit misleading as i have yet to find a k cup that delivers the full zing of a shot of espresso either way in the k cup genre this one is among my favorites give it a go br br pricing here at amazon is excellent just wish they offered the variety of makers that i have found at other online sources 
Original summary: the best that timothy 's offers

Review: overall i 'm pleased with the quality of these chews the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars is because a number of the strips are cut in such a way that they have sharp slender points i have 2 springer spaniel pups that love these things so much that they try to gulp them down without much chewing i keep a close eye on my pups while they eat these chews to ensure that they do n't get caught in their throats we have had one get caught in the roof of the mouth i sometimes smash the points with a hammer just for my own peace of mind the dogs love them i have to keep them in the laundry room because they can smell them i ca n't if i keep them in the kitchen which leads to begging and pawing

Review: this is hands down the best dog food we have ever found i have 2 boston terriers who putting it mildly have issues one throws up when given anything out of the ordinary the other has skin problems and allergies normally we find a dry food that may work for one and not the other at the end of the bag of nutrisca both dogs were remarkably improved there were no digestive issues both had stopped the constant need for scratching both had the missing fur in hot spot areas both were energetic happy and healthy br there was a time when we were unable to find nutrisca and so tried other foods that came very highly recommended by our local hippie doggie boutique but where one dog might do well the other suffered not to mention the huge price difference
