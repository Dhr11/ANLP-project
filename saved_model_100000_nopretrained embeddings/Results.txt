Review: this is the dense flavorful chocolate cake associated with eastern european jewish tradition although anyone who loves cake and chocolate will appreciate this this cake is especially generous with the chocolate which is more dark chocolate than milk chocolate but that is healthy right the texture is more like bread than cake but in a good way i would buy it again or its sister cake the a href '' http www amazon com gp product '' greens mini cinnamon babka 16 oz a br br so why only 4 stars i am not sure but i think i detect more than just a hint of chocolate liquor which i like but if there were small children in the house it could be a problem the label makes no mention of the chocolate liquor but there is clearly a pleasant alcohol flavor similar to the alcohol flavor one finds in a really good rum cake br br speaking of which if this chocolate babka is out of stock you ca n't go wrong with this amazing a href '' http www amazon com gp product '' tortuga caribbean rum cake golden original 33 ounce cake a do n't want to commit to the 33 ounce cake yet no worries try the a href '' http www amazon com gp product '' tortuga original caribbean rum cake 16 ounce cake a or even the a href '' http www amazon com gp product '' tortuga caribbean golden original rum cake 4 ounce boxes pack of 6 a br br bon appetit to all my foodie brothers and sisters

Review: surprisingly good br br very easy to make but it did take more watching and stirring than i would have liked a nice alternative to hamburger helper when you need a desperation dinner br br the kit consists of a packet of risotto a rice shaped pasta a flavor pack a pack of freeze dried broccoli and a pouch of velveeta cheese you provide and brown your own chicken boil the rice with the flavor packet add the chicken add the broccoli it looks and smells weird out of the pack and finish by adding the cheese the final product looks ok only vaguely reminiscent of vomit but it tastes and smells good it did not taste as salty as i had expected much less salty tasting than hamburger helper but i did feel thirsty after i ate it br br you could also make it without the chicken for a vegetarian version or if you are feeling particularly lazy 
Original summary: surprisingly good 
Predicted summary:  not as good as the broccoli

Review: the very 1st thing i noticed about this product was how nasty it tasted i 've tried stevia by numerous manufacturers plus i read the excellent reviews and this is hands down the worst br br when i finally read the actual ingredients i had assumed it was stevia and discovered that the very 1st ingredient was n't stevia but rice i was shocked and angry i have a liver disorder and can not pump crap like maltodextrin into my liver hence the use of stevia an all natural product beware if you have diabetes and think this is a safe sugar substitute it 's not below is a quote from a website the link follows and there are plenty of others with warnings for maltodextrin for those who are looking for an safe sugar substitute br br plus i do n't care what anyone says if you think this is the best stevia product ever and many actually do then you have n't tried the right stevia manufacturer now is n't one of them br i ordered this shoe in the correct size but they were huge i am returning them hoping that the smaller size will work they match the dress perfect are adorable br '' it 's the combination that may because spikes in insulin because maltodextrin is a carbohydrate with a high glycemic index similar to table sugar and should be used in moderation if you have diabetes or hypoglycemia you must consider the carbohydrate content of products sweetened with added maltodextrin to maintain healthy blood sugar levels br br read more

Review: tonight i had a light lettuce based salad for dinner and to go with it i opened up an 18 6 ounce can of campbell 's chunky chicken noodle soup healthy request variety i thought it to be a rather bland tasting chicken noodle soup but that 's because most chicken soups have such a high sodium content this one is relatively low and in fact the potassium content is higher than the sodium content which is almost of in campbell 's soups it 's fairly low in calories also so a whole can two servings only amounted to 220 calories also the fat content is low and the protein content is fairly high i 'm surprised they do n't label this a diet soup '' both the spiral noodles and the vegetables carrots and celery are fairly large and chunky '' and all seem bland and overcooked i would not regard this soup as a particularly good one but if you want to open a can of soup for a meal the mix of nutrients is superior to most br br gary peterson

Review: that 's the best way to describe it you pop it in your mouth and the sensation is similar to chewing on beef jerky only much better the flavor starts to come through very quickly creamy and aromatic br br it 's certainly the easiest way to get the full mango flavor experience without the mess the quality is consistent you do n't get the odd funny tasting piece like you do with other dried fruits br br this is a terrific snack the chewiness makes each bite last and the flavor just keeps coming you can easily make a single serving size last 5 minutes and there are n't many snack foods that can match that

Review: do n't let then negative reviews deter you from trying these if you are expecting them to taste like something from olive garden right out of the package you will be pretty disappointed they are nothing like the standard italian style pasta but if you know how to cook they are great i make mine in spicy asian inspired dishes follow the directions on the package and you will have a nice addition to your meal i would never even attempt to eat these plain they turn what would normally be a 500 600 calorie dish into less than 100 for a very similar flavor they absorb the flavor of the sauce soup you put them in i make them for lunches a day or so ahead of time and store them with the noodles on the bottom so they soak up as much flavor as possible

Review: my lab mix loves this toy when he was a pup he had a hard time figuring it out and would get frustrated and just bark at it but as he got older he tossed it around enough to get some food out what really helped was sitting down with him and shaking some out getting him to pull on the rope etc what you can also do is take out the rope if that makes it easier and then if they would got the hang of it add the rope again using smaller food helps too it was fun to see him finally figure out a strategy for getting the food out
