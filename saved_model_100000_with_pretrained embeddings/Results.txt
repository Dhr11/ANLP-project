Review: my wife bought this at a store as an impulse buy it was cheap so no big deal but i had doubts that it would grow since we live in an apartment with only a small that does n't get much light br br i did not do a great job planting either i grabbed a clump of dirt off the top poured in the seeds and threw the clump of dirt back down on top noticing it was probably too deep for the seeds i shook the bag most of the seeds ended up on top i figured it was a lost because maybe a couple strands would grow br br 4 days later i noticed several grass stalks this without being in the sun mind you once the stalks got above the height of the bag i put it outside where it gets maybe 3 hours of light and a week later it was br br this stuff is incredibly thick not browning at all and incredibly strong our cat loves it and no she has n't thrown up from eating it which was our main concern br br i am very glad my wife purchased this stuff i always felt bad that our cat who was probably a stray for many years and used to the outdoors before we adopted her was up in an apartment now she can at least enjoy getting a bit of sun and nibbling on some fresh plants

Review: so after seeing the great sale price 30 value for 10 and reading the item title 12 pk 2 pack i assumed i was getting a total of 24 meals 12 pack x 2 since this item runs about 1 10 at target normally but after place my order i only received pack per order so the savings are not worth it esp after adding in the shipping fees from petco you are much better off just paying the normal retail price at target

Review: this tea is a great price and had great reviews which is why i opted to try this in the past i had purchased my bulk hibiscus from and the quality was amazing this is n't quite as good as the kind but since they went out of business davidson 's seems like the best economical alternative the petals are really large but this is n't an issue for me since i use what is essentially a giant tea ball i make iced tea to make to drink while at work to make a large quantity at a time i purchased a 3 '' spice ball like this one available from amazon br i use this spice ball in a large pot of heated to proper tea temperature water and steep accordingly and then i have a large container of iced hibiscus tea br i gave this tea 4 starts as opposed to 5 because they could clean up some of the odd bits in there they seem to throw in other parts than the petals it 's not really a big deal but doing so would make it more 5 star quality good product great price 
Original summary: great product

Review: i would caution anyone ordering this to realize that the chocolate melts in warm temperatures mine arrived in a chocolate coated bag i put it in the fridge to try to solidify it a bit but it was n't a big improvement makes it hard to eat out of the bag i really did n't want a chocolate flavored cereal so i was planning on enjoying this as an eat out of the bag snack but the melted chocolate makes it messy the chunks are an okay size for that but it would probably work better as a cereal since the chocolate melted br br when i purchase granola i usually look for ones with either almonds or pecans this has neither the only solids listed in the ingredients are whole grain rolled oats and chocolate chunks first 2 ingredients the rest of the ingredients are sweeteners a serving is 1 2 cup and that has 220 calories 50 of which are from fat there are 4g of fiber 13g of sugar 20g of other carbohydrates and 5g of protein just because something is natural '' does n't mean it is good for you

Review: these are darn tasty but subtle they are not the pepper '' in the name is n't just black pepper these nuts are hot and spicy and very very salty good with a cocktail or a cold beer they are too powerful to eat without a drink in hand the subtle sweetness of cashews is lost in the coating you could make the same product out of peanuts more cheaply without really affecting the snacking experience all in all though they are a good nosh the best of the three emerald '' flavors i 've tried
